To adapt your README instructions for working with Google Cloud's managed database service, Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, with multiple instances for higher availability and robustness, here are the steps you would follow:

1. **Set up Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL:**

   Before you can start using Google Cloud SQL, you need to set up your project in Google Cloud Platform and enable the Cloud SQL Admin API.

2. **Create Cloud SQL Instance:**

   You can create a new Cloud SQL instance in the Google Cloud Console or using the `gcloud` command-line tool.

3. **Configure High Availability:**

   During the instance creation process, select the option for high availability. This will configure the instance to run across multiple zones to ensure robustness.

4. **Set up Database and Tables:**

   After your instance is set up, connect to it using `gcloud` or a SQL client to create your database and tables.

Hereâ€™s how you could update the instructions:

# Setting up PostgreSQL on Google Cloud SQL

1. Update `gcloud` to the latest version:

```bash
gcloud components update
```

2. Create a new Cloud SQL instance with High Availability:

```bash
gcloud sql instances create [INSTANCE_NAME] --availability-type=REGIONAL --database-version=POSTGRES_13 --cpu=[NUMBER_OF_CPUS] --memory=[MEMORY_SIZE] --region=[REGION]
```

Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]`, `[NUMBER_OF_CPUS]`, `[MEMORY_SIZE]`, and `[REGION]` with your desired configuration.

3. Once the instance is created, set the root password:

```bash
gcloud sql users set-password postgres --instance=[INSTANCE_NAME] --password=[PASSWORD]
```

Replace `[INSTANCE_NAME]` and `[PASSWORD]` with your instance name and a secure password.

4. Connect to your Cloud SQL instance:

```bash
gcloud sql connect [INSTANCE_NAME] --user=postgres
```

5. Create a new database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE store_demo;
```

6. Create tables and load mock data:

```bash
gcloud sql connect [INSTANCE_NAME] --user=postgres --database=store_demo < db/create_tables.sql
```

Make sure to upload your `create_tables.sql` and CSV files to Google Cloud Storage or have them accessible to the Cloud SQL instance.

7. Load data from CSV files stored in Google Cloud Storage:

```sql
\copy merchants FROM 'gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/data/merchants.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER);
\copy users FROM 'gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/data/users.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER);
\copy user_history FROM 'gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/data/user_history.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER);
\copy payment_methods FROM 'gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/data/payment_methods.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER);
\copy products FROM 'gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/data/merchant_products.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER);
```

Replace `[BUCKET_NAME]` with the name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket where the CSV files are stored.
```

**Note:**
- Ensure the SQL user and passwords are managed securely.
- Replace placeholders with actual values.
- You might need to adjust SQL permissions and networking (e.g., authorizing your IP) to connect to the Cloud SQL instance.
- Google Cloud SQL does not directly support `\copy`. You'll need to use `gcloud sql import csv` or load the data into the instance from a machine that has access to it.
- To run multiple instances, you would typically set up a high availability (HA) configuration, not separate instances. If you truly need separate instances, you might be looking into setting up a sharded database or a read replica for load balancing, which are more advanced configurations.

These instructions would serve as a starting point, and you may need to fine-tune the commands based on the specifics of your Google Cloud environment and the size of the PostgreSQL instance you intend to create.


To set up Google Cloud Storage and upload your CSV files, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Google Cloud SDK:**

   First, make sure that you have the Google Cloud SDK installed. If it's not installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Google Cloud SDK documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

2. **Initialize gcloud:**

   If you haven't already initialized `gcloud`, do so by running:

   ```bash
   gcloud init
   ```

Follow the prompts to log in and set your default project.

3. **Create a new bucket:**

   Google Cloud Storage organizes files in "buckets." Create a new bucket (with a unique name) to store your CSV files by running:

   ```bash
   gsutil mb gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/
   ```

   Replace `[BUCKET_NAME]` with your desired unique bucket name.

4. **Set bucket permissions:**

   Adjust the permissions of the bucket as necessary to control access:

   ```bash
   gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
   ```

   This command grants all users permission to view objects in your bucket. For production environments, you will want to restrict this to only the necessary accounts.

5. **Upload files to the bucket:**

   You can now upload your CSV files to the created bucket:

   ```bash
   gsutil cp path/to/your/file.csv gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/data/
   ```

   Replace `path/to/your/file.csv` with the path to your CSV file.

6. **Verify the files:**

   Confirm that your files are in the bucket:

   ```bash
   gsutil ls gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/data/
   ```

This should list all the files you've uploaded to the `data/` directory of your bucket.

Remember to replace `[BUCKET_NAME]` with the actual name of your bucket in each of these commands. Each bucket name must be globally unique.

**Note:** Always be careful with permissions. The example command given for setting the IAM policy on the bucket allows anyone on the internet to view objects in the bucket, which is typically not recommended unless the data is meant to be public. Use more restrictive permissions for sensitive data.
