To store shopping carts in a cookie per merchant, you can use the `js-cookie` library for handling cookies in a Next.js application. This library provides a simple API for managing cookies on both the client and server-side.

First, install the `js-cookie` package:

```bash
npm install js-cookie
```

Then, you can use it in your cart context or wherever you're handling the cart logic:

Sure, here's a TypeScript version of the `useCart` hook with type annotations for your cart items and the merchant ID:

```typescript
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import Cookies from 'js-cookie';

interface CartItem {
  id: string;
  quantity: number;
  price: number;
  // ... any other properties of a cart item
}

interface Carts {
  [merchantId: number]: CartItem[];
}

const useCart = (merchantId: number) => {
  // ... your existing hooks and state
  let carts: Carts = {}; // This should be stored in a useState or useReducer for a real implementation

  // Function to save the cart to a cookie
  const saveCartToCookie = (merchantId: number, cart: CartItem[]): void => {
    Cookies.set(`cart_${merchantId}`, JSON.stringify(cart), { expires: 7 }); // Expires in 7 days
  };

  // Function to load the cart from a cookie
  const loadCartFromCookie = (merchantId: number): CartItem[] => {
    const cart = Cookies.get(`cart_${merchantId}`);
    return cart ? JSON.parse(cart) : [];
  };

  // ... rest of your logic

  // Example of how to use these functions when the cart updates
  useEffect(() => {
    saveCartToCookie(merchantId, carts[merchantId]);
  }, [carts, merchantId]);

  // When the component mounts, you might want to load the cart
  useEffect(() => {
    const merchantCart = loadCartFromCookie(merchantId);
    // setCart would be a function that you define to update your cart state
    // setCart(merchantCart);
  }, [merchantId]);

  // ... the rest of your cart context logic

  // Make sure to return what you need from this hook
  return { /* whatever state and functions you need to expose */ };
};

export default useCart;
```

In this TypeScript version, `CartItem` is an interface describing the shape of items in the cart, and `Carts` is a type representing an object with numeric keys mapping to an array of `CartItem` objects. The `merchantId` is typed as a `number` in the function parameters. The `saveCartToCookie` and `loadCartFromCookie` functions are also annotated to indicate they do not return anything (`void`) and that they return an array of `CartItem` objects, respectively.

Please note that this is a simplified example and you would need to integrate it properly with the state management of your React application. This might involve using `useState`, `useReducer`, or a context provider to store and update your `carts` state.

In this example, `saveCartToCookie` function is used to save the cart to a cookie, with a key that is unique per merchant based on the merchant ID. The `loadCartFromCookie` function retrieves the cart from the cookie if it exists. The `useEffect` hooks are there to update the cookie when the cart changes and to load the cart from the cookie when the component mounts.

Be aware that there are limitations to the size of cookies (generally around 4 KB per cookie), so if you're expecting a large amount of data, consider a server-side solution with a database instead.

Furthermore, you must handle cookies responsibly, respecting user privacy and being compliant with laws like the GDPR or CCPA. This often means getting user consent before storing data in cookies.
