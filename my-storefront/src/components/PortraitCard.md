Component: `PortraitCard`

### What it is:
`PortraitCard` is a React functional component that assembles a card with a portrait orientation. It is designed to contain an image, some information, and an action item.

### How to use it:

1. **Import the component** where you want to use the card:
   ```tsx
   import PortraitCard from './components/PortraitCard';
   ```

2. **Use the `<PortraitCard>` component** within your JSX, providing the components for `image`, `info`, and `action` as children:
   ```tsx
   <PortraitCard 
     image={<YourImageComponent />} 
     info={<YourInfoComponent />} 
     action={<YourActionComponent />} 
   />
   ```

### Props:

- `image`: A React node, typically an image or visual representation to be placed at the top of the card.
- `info`: A React node containing information about the card subject, such as text or a list of items.
- `action`: A React node, usually including buttons or interactive elements for the user to perform an action related to the card.

### Internal Logic:

- It doesn't contain any internal state or complex logic, serving primarily as a structure to display its children components.

### Styling:

- The card has a white background, rounded corners, and a shadow for depth, giving it a card-like appearance.
- It's centered with `mx-auto` and has a maximum width of `md`.
- The image is assumed to be at the top, followed by the `info` and `action` content, both padded and allowed to grow with `flex-grow`.

### Accessibility:

- The component doesn't provide any specific accessibility features like ARIA attributes; additional attributes should be added where necessary, especially if `action` includes interactive elements.

### User Interaction:

- `PortraitCard` itself doesn't handle user interactions, but it's expected that the `action` component will contain interactive elements like buttons.

### Rendering:

- Renders a `<div>` with a `flex` column layout containing the `image`, followed by two `<div>` elements for `info` and `action` content, allowing them to grow to fill the space within the card.
