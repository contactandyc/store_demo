Component: `MerchantCard`

### What it is:
A React functional component that renders a card for a merchant with a list of their products as small images using sprites.

### How to use it:

1. **Import the component** where you want to display a list of merchants:
   ```tsx
   import MerchantCard from './components/MerchantCard';
   ```

2. **Place the `<MerchantCard>` component** in your component tree, providing the necessary merchant data as a prop:
   ```tsx
   <MerchantCard merchant={merchantData} />
   ```

### Props:
- `merchant`: An object containing merchant details such as `id`, `name`, and an array of `products`.

### Internal Logic:
- Uses `ImageFromSprite` component to display product images.
- Wraps each product image in a horizontally scrollable container if there are multiple products.

### Styling:
- Each product is wrapped in a div with a class to prevent shrinking (`min-w-max`).
- The container for products uses a thin scrollbar (`scrollbarWidth: 'thin'`).

### Accessibility:
- Each product image should have an appropriate alt text, which could be added in the `ImageFromSprite` component if not already there.

### User Interaction:
- The entire `MerchantCard` is clickable, and it uses Next.js's `Link` component to navigate to the merchant's page.

### Rendering:
- Shows the merchant's name in a bold, larger font.
- Renders a horizontally scrollable list of product images or a message if no products are found.
- Utilizes the `ImageFromSprite` component to display product images based on sprite positions.
