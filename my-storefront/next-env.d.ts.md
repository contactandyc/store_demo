The `next-env.d.ts` file is a TypeScript declaration file that is automatically generated and used by Next.js when you set up TypeScript in your project. This file includes type definitions for Next.js specific features and APIs, which allows TypeScript to understand the types being used and provide appropriate type checking and autocompletion.

Hereâ€™s what it includes:

- `/// <reference types="next" />`: This line includes type declarations for Next.js, so you get types for Next.js APIs like `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse`.

- `/// <reference types="next/image-types/global" />`: This line provides types for the Next.js `Image` component and ensures that TypeScript understands the image optimization types.

**Note**: As mentioned in the comment within the file, you should not manually edit this file. It is managed by Next.js, and changes are generally made by the framework itself when you install or update Next.js or related types.

The link provided in the comment (https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript) takes you to the Next.js documentation page for TypeScript, which provides more information on using TypeScript with Next.js, including setup and configuration.
